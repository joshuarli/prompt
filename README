tbh the absolute best way to do this would be
to port this nim into my shell's source code

zsh supports all of the prompt except my git part:
export PROMPT='%n@%m %1d $ '

i should add a %g for git branch.

zsh vcs_info function has branch name:
# autoload -Uz vcs_info
# precmd() vcs_info
# PS1='%~$vcs_info_msg_0_ '
# setopt prompt_subst
but it ultimately shells out to git.
we can achieve much smaller prompt latency by doing this in-process.


## building zsh

--disable-etcdir

macos system /etc/profile involves path_helper which is god awful.
(can also be achieved with setopt no_global_rcs in zshenv)
I only use ~/.zshenv (which just sources my ~/.profile) and ~/.zshrc.
zshenv: sourced on all invocations of the shell, unless the -f option is set.
    It should contain commands to set the command search path, plus other important environment variables.
    Should not contain commands that produce output or assume the shell is attached to a tty.
zshrc: sourced on interactive shells.

./configure \
--disable-etcdir \
--disable-dynamic-nss \
--enable-dynamic \
--disable-restricted-r \
--disable-locale \
--disable-largefile

make -j4
make install.bin

# important to install function definition files for compinit
# which loads those functions (either from fresh or zcompdump)
make install.fns

/usr/local/bin/zsh

# only the Zle/ functions are relevant to the nice completion i enjoy
# i've tried --enable-function-subdirs and only setting FPATH to Zle/
# but it doesn't seem to work, so i've deleted all others
# autoload -U compinit && compinit -d "${XDG_CACHE_HOME}/zsh/zcompdump"

# TODO: figure out how to get expand_alias back - it's a "completion widget"

  - this is cool but a little too much for me, i'd rather keep my needs minimal
